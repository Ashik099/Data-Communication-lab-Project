# Data-Communication-lab-Project
 This project is a Java implementation of Hamming Distance, Parity Check, Bits Stuffing, Bits Destuffing, and Character Stuffing. The project is designed to be used as a reference for understanding these techniques and to provide a starting point for developing your own applications that use these techniques. 
The project is divided into the following modules: 
  • Hamming Distance: This module implements the Hamming Distance algorithm.
  • Parity Check: This module implements the Parity Check algorithm.
  • Bits Stuffing: This module implements the Bits Stuffing algorithm.
  • Bits Destuffing: This module implements the Bits Destuffing algorithm.
  • Character Stuffing: This module implements the Character Stuffing algorithm.
 
The project also includes a main class that demonstrates how to use the different modules
